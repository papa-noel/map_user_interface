**HOW TO USE**
After cloning the repo, right click on the index.html file. In the pop-up window, click on 'Open with Live Server'. This will open a google chrome tab
(if you are using google chrome) with the interactive google map. At the top of the map is a *Zoom Level* indicator which lets you know what level of
zoom you are currently observing. This is necessary because we trained our model at Zoom Level: 19. To the left, there are 3 buttons (excluding the
map/satellite buttons which switch the map layout). The *Center Map* button will center the map automatically on San Diego. The *Training Areas* button
will toggle on and off the highlighting of the locations of our training areas. The *Identify Poles* button is the button we will use to run our model.
This button currently does not do anything. Our next steps will be to figure out how to run the model when this button is pressed.
